1. Run `yarn` to install depedencies.
2. Run `HTTPS=true yarn start` to start the demo.

After starting the app, you may need to first log in to https://localhost:3000/account.html. You can use the same credentials you are using at https://secure.gooddata.com/.

Note: To simplify the initial setup, this demo uses a hard-coded reference to GoodData's GoodSales demo project, and it uses a local proxy server to work around issues with cross-origin requests. For a production-ready CORS setup, please refer to the [tutorial on accessing the GoodData API directly without a local proxy](https://help.gooddata.com/display/bHsp5IhQjuz0e6HS0s76/How+to+Access+the+GoodData+API+Directly).
