# Event Handling Demo

This simplistic app shows how to use GoodData UI SDK to display a result
of a metric defined in a GoodData workspace.

This app was created according to the user guide available from [here](https://help.gooddata.com/display/bHsp5IhQjuz0e6HS0s76/How+to+Create+Your+First+Visualization+with+GoodData+UI+SDK).

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). You can find more information on how to perform common tasks with the create-react-app tooling [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).

## Getting Started

After starting the app you may need to log in first at https://localhost:3000/account.html. You can use the same credentials you are using at https://secure.gooddata.com/.

## Caution

Note: for the sake of simplicity of the initial setup, this demo uses a hard-coded reference to GoodData's GoodSales demo and it uses a local proxy server to workaround issues with cross-origin requests. For a production ready CORS setup please refer to the [tutorial on accessing GoodData API directly without a local proxy](https://help.gooddata.com/display/bHsp5IhQjuz0e6HS0s76/How+to+Access+the+GoodData+API+Directly).
