# Event Handling Demo

This app shows how to use the GoodData UI SDK [Drill Eventing](https://help.gooddata.com/display/doc/Sample+HTML+for+Drill+Eventing).

This app was created according to the tutorial available from [here](https://help.gooddata.com/display/bHsp5IhQjuz0e6HS0s76/How+to+Create+Your+First+Visualization+with+GoodData+UI+SDK).

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). You can find more information on how to perform common tasks with the create-react-app tooling [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).

## Getting Started

See [How to run a demo](https://github.com/gooddata/ui-sdk-examples#how-to-run-a-demo) for how to start the app.

After starting the app, you may need to first log in to https://localhost:3000/account.html. You can use the same credentials you are using at https://secure.gooddata.com/.

## Caution

Note: To simplify the initial setup, this demo uses a hard-coded reference to GoodData's GoodSales demo project, and it uses a local proxy server to work around issues with cross-origin requests. For a production-ready CORS setup, please refer to the [tutorial on accessing the GoodData API directly without a local proxy](https://help.gooddata.com/display/bHsp5IhQjuz0e6HS0s76/How+to+Access+the+GoodData+API+Directly).
