A minimalistic demo of using GoodData React components using plain old
vanilla JavaScript.

The `gooddata_react_components_bundle.js` bundle has been created using
the webpack configuration and a custom entry from the `create-bundle`
folder.

See comments at the top of the `create-bundle/vanilla.js` file for more details.
