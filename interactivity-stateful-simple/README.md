# Simple Interactivity Demo (Stateful React Component) 

This demo provides a simplistic example of shows how React stateful
components and GoodData UI SDK can be used to create interactive user
interfaces.

See also the [simple Redux demo](https://github.com/gooddata/ui-sdk-examples/tree/master/interactivity-redux-simple)
and the [full AFM Redux demo]((https://github.com/gooddata/ui-sdk-examples/tree/master/interactivity-redux-fullAFM)
if you are interested how to build interactive user interfaces using Redux.

## Getting Started

1. Run `yarn` to install depedencies.
2. Run `HTTPS=true yarn start` to start the demo.

## Caution

Note: To simplify the initial setup, this demo uses a hard-coded
reference to GoodData's GoodSales demo project, and it uses a local
proxy server to work around issues with cross-origin requests. For a
production-ready CORS setup, please refer to the [tutorial on accessing
the GoodData API directly without a local
proxy](https://help.gooddata.com/display/bHsp5IhQjuz0e6HS0s76/How+to+Access+the+GoodData+API+Directly).
