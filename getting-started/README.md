This simplistic app shows how to use GoodData UI SDK to display a result
of a metric defined in a GoodData workspace.

This app was created according to the user guide available from [here -
TODO GH pages](https://todo).

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). You can find more information on how to perform common tasks with the create-react-app tooling [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).
